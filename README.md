# Minecraft-Forge-1.20.1-TPose-Animation-With-Keybind
This mod demonstrates how to track a keybind press on the client, send that state to the server, synchronize it across all clients, and render a custom T‑Pose animation based on a per‑player capability. It is fully multiplayer‑compatible and uses Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 networking and capability systems.
